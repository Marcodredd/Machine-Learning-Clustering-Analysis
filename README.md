# Machine-Learning-Clustering-Analysis
## Clustering Algorithms using the Clustering dataset
After taken the course Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024] on Udemy by Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves and others.

The data housing.csv was downloaded from Kaggle.
Basically, only the latitude and longitude and the median house price will be used to see how these locations determine the price of a house.

The following algorithms will be implemented to see the segmentation:
1. K-means
2. Hierarchical clustering

You can see from the graph that both displayed similar results.
